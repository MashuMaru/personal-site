        <h3 className="about-description">I am a self-taught website and web application developer.</h3>
        <p className="about-details">I was a Principle Electrical Design Engineer in a Building Services Consultancy, 
        until I realised I wanted something different in my career, something more inline my interests.</p>
        <p className="about-details">I then started learning web development in 2019 using online courses and self-teaching in my own time. 
        Programming and coding has always been an interest of mine, so took this opportunity to push and learn.</p>
        <p className="about-details">Since then, I have built websites, webapplications and even a couple of web games.
        I love coffee (especially Starbucks Caramel Frappuccino), hiking and music. </p>
        <p className="about-details">My aim for the future is to work full time in Web Development and programming,
        and work with as many clients to bring their ideas into reality. </p>
